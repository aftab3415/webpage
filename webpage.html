    <p id="aip"> &nbsp; In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence,
       is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.
        Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents":
        any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.
     Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind,
      such as "learning" and "problem solving".

    <p id="mlp"> &nbsp; It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data",
      in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications,
       such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

    <img id="img4" src="C:\Users\saniy\OneDrive\Desktop\files\sample_website\dl.jpeg" alt="image not supported">
    <p id="dlp"> &nbsp; Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.
       Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. Deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks,
       recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, machine vision, speech recognition,
       natural language processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis,
        material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.
